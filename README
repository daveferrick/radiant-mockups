== Radiant CMS Mockups Project

This is a sub-project of Radiant CMS (http://radiantcms.org) designed to make
it easier for people to contribute to and extend Radiant.

Mockups allow us to experiment with the Radiant interface without getting
too hung up over the details of how it will be implemented.

= Can I contribute?

Absolutely! We welcome contributions to the mockups project. In fact, if you
have ideas for how Radiant can be improved this is one of the best places to
start. Fork the project on GitHub and check in your revised mockups. Then ask
for feedback on the mailing list (http://radiantcms.org/mailing-list).
